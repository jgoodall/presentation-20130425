    h2 Mission
    p(style='font-size: 1.5em; text-align:left') Develop situation awareness and visual analytics tools, methods and platforms to facilitate <strong>situational understanding</strong> and <strong>insight discovery</strong> from large, complex, heterogeneous data
    aside.notes
      | Our mission is to enable users to discover facts about their data, or connections within their data, that would otherwise remain hidden.
  section
    h2 Approach to Visual Analytics
    ul
      li Automate the repetitive and the mundane
      li Algorithms should not relearn domain knowledge
      li Users' domain knowledge should be captured and used
      li Algorithms should be transparent and understandable
      li Simple displays are good (and better when combined)
      li Visualizations do not always have to be intuitive
      li Give users time to slow down to explore the data

    h2 geovar :: problem
    ul
      li CMS created public health indicator data sets at the different geographic levels for public use, but the files are just data tables which are not easily digested by non-experts
      li Need an easily understandable visualization to show variations and changes over time and locale for many different health indicators

      li Combine visualizations to show how geographic regions compare

  section
    h2 link-ui :: approach
    ul

      li Visualization to let the user correct or add links to each field

  section
    h2 nv :: problem
    ul
      li Vulnerability assessment tools can expose weak points within a computing network
      li These tools can produce very large data sets in medium/large networks
      li It can be difficult to get the big picture of the security posture of your network from current user interfaces for vulnerability assessment tools
      li It is impossible to compare scans to determine the differences between them - has the network become more vulnerable or more secure?
      li Users' domain knowledge is not taken into account
  section
    h2 nv :: approach
    ul
      li Web-based, zoomable treemap of host vulnerabilities for entire network
      li Visualize a single vulnerability scan shows the state of the network
      li Compare two vulnerability scans shows fixed, new, and open issues
      li Re-orderable data hierarchy (group, IP, port, issue)
      li View issues by severity, criticality or count
      li Filter interactively by severity, issue type, top issues
      li User defined groupings of assets and tagging of high-value assets

    h3 A Scalable Framework for Timely Discovery and Situational Understanding of Cyber Attacks
    p
      img(src='img/situ-thumb.png', style='border:none;')
  section
    h2 situ :: problem
    ul
      li Cyber attacks cost commercial and governmental organizations vast dollar amounts, result in stolen intellectual property, and reveal state secrets that endanger lives
      li Sophisticated attack groups have established a presence in the networks of many organizations
      li Discovering novel and sophisticated cyber attacks and providing situation awareness are ongoing problems in computer network defense
      li Cyber defense analysts maintain continually evolving mental models that allow them to differentiate between malicious and benign traffic, but current systems do not exploit this knowledge
      li Current attack discovery systems typically focus on a single type of data, even though some sophisticated attacks can only be identified from looking at multiple data sets
  section
    h2 situ :: problem
    br
    h4 Current systems focus technologies at identifying attacks, but provide little in the way of helping analysts make rapid decisions
  section
    h2 situ :: approach
    ul
      li Anomaly detection - unsupervised, probabilistic modeling of data for different contexts allows the system to model behavior at multiple scales
      li Event classification - supervised machine learning algorithms allow users to incorporate their own domain knowledge into the system
      li Information visualization - real-time event visualization provides an understanding of why events are anomalous and malicious to furnish users with the information to make decisions
      li Feedback loop - a context-aware learning feedback loop helps to provide labeled data to algorithms while minimizing the burden on users
